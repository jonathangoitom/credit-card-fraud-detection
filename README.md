## Introduction 
Credit card fraud is a significant problem in the financial industry. This project aims to develop a logistic regression model to predict fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, SMOTE is used to generate synthetic samples and balance the dataset.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jonathangoitom/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
2. Install the necessary packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook: jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
2. Run the cells in the notebook in order to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch: git checkout -b new-feature
3. Make your changes and commit them: git commit -m 'Add new feature'
4. Push to the branch: git push origin new-feature
5. Submit a pull request

## Credits
* The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset on Kaggle
* The imbalanced-learn library for implementing SMOTE in the model
* Scikit-learn for implementing the logistic regression model
